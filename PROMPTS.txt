Ordered prompts for subagents (each subagent:  commit your work to a feature branch when done):
1) Rust sampling core: implement polyline/multiline densification + validation per docs/specs/proposed/2025-11-20_geometry-distance-metrics.md (spacing knobs, sample caps, duplicate collapse, lat/lon validation); add FlattenedPolyline helpers and tests for caps/degeneracy/error paths;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
2) Rust Hausdorff kernel: build directed/symmetric Hausdorff over densified polylines with optional bbox clipping, witness mapping, and naive vs rstar strategy selection; add regression tests for tie-breaking, empty inputs, and strategy thresholds;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
3) PyO3 bindings for Hausdorff: expose polyline densification + Hausdorff options and witness structs through PyO3; keep `_loxodrome_rs.pyi` in sync and add binding-level smoke tests;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
4) Rust kernels (Chamfer): build Chamfer (mean/sum/max) for polyline/multiline using shared densification + KD-tree path; emit witness only for `reduction="max"` per spec; PyO3 bindings + `_loxodrome_rs.pyi`; tests;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
5) Python surface + tests: wire new polyline/multiline Hausdorff + Chamfer APIs, dataclasses/TypedDicts, fixtures mirroring spec defaults; keep scope to code/tests only (docs separate);  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
6) Docs + roadmap: add README/notebook/docstring coverage for the new metrics, sampling knobs, and clipping semantics; update docs/specs/proposed/2025-11-24_loxodrome-mvp-roadmap.md status;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
7) Spatial index wrappers: expose rstar-backed build/query helpers (nearest/intersects) with Euclidean envelope caveats, bounds knobs, and tests; document API choices in code comments and keep `_loxodrome_rs.pyi` aligned;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
8) Boolean ops path: add polygon/linestring union/intersection via Rust kernel or optional GEOS extra (guarded imports, dependency isolation), with validation and edge-case tests; surface bindings and update `_loxodrome_rs.pyi`;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
9) Tessellation for Z comparison (design + skeleton): implement densify-then-triangulate pipeline with configurable spacing/angle/sample caps and placeholder comparison metrics; include synthetic tests/fixtures;  commit your work to a feature branch when done.
